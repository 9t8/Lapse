# Lapse
Lapse is a Java GUI app designed to create time-lapses of the user's face, made with a partner in a 24-hour hackathon. It takes webcam photos, aligns the faces, and reminds the user to take photos consistently. It detects eyes using the Google Cloud Vision API and transforms images so the eyes appear in fixed positions.
